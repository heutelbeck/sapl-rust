# embedded-pdp - A SAPL Policy Decision Point (PDP)
This library implements a PDP with the help of the sapl-core library.
Since this implementation cannot be accessed via a network connection, it is referred to as embedded. This library can either be used directly in an application together with a PEP or be the basis for an SAPL PDP server such as sapl-server-rs.
